I began my journey in technology during school, developing my first website in 9th grade and my first application in 10th grade. By 11th standard, I was exploring blogging, YouTube, and AdSense, and during 12th I experimented with branding my work under the name **QuickSky**. After graduation, I briefly worked at **GetOnKart**, where I assisted the team and, recognizing my skills, the management offered me the opportunity to teach HTML, CSS, and PHP to their interns.

In 2018, I enrolled in B.Tech Computer Science at Kurukshetra University and formally launched my venture **NavMake**, focusing on freelance app and web development, along with digital marketing. During my first year of college, I expanded **NavMake** by launching **NavDelight**, an online fruits and vegetables delivery platform. I also secured incubation support at my university, helped aspiring entrepreneurs with their startups, and served as Student Coordinator of the ED Cell, where I founded the **Empresarios Club** to promote entrepreneurship.

During the crypto boom, I founded **FradX**, India’s first crypto mutual funds app. To gain corporate industry experience, I completed an internship as a **Mobile App Developer** at **Vibe Internet Solutions** in Mohali, where I was later promoted to **Associate Software Engineer**. I then advanced my career as a **Senior Android Developer** at **Asrit Technologies** and subsequently joined **AU Small Finance Bank** as **Manager** (Technical Analyst).

In 2024, I left AU Bank to pursue my startup **Fame**, a social media application. However, the project was discontinued due to resource limitations. In April 2025, I joined **India IPO** as a **Full Stack Developer** but decided to move on owing to the work environment. Since May 2025, I have been freelancing while seeking opportunities to deliver impact in a full-time role.
